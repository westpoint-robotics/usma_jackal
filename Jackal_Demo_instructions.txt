This demo allows joystick control of the Jackal with a remotely viewable rviz showing the pointcloud and laser scan.
- In RVIZ the laser scan is a 2D representation of the 3D point cloud. RVIZ is configured to display this as 2cm BLUE squares. 
- The color of the 3d point cloud varies based on the intensity of the return.

To Run the demo:
1. Press the Jackal power button (not the red button).
2. Once the power button lights up solid blue and the mobility button is solid green, then press the RED BUTTON to trigger the Jackal computer to start.
3. Allow about 1 minute wait time.
4. On this computer open a terminal and type in 'jackalviz' and press <enter>. The command jackalviz is an alias located inside the .bashrc file. This alias sets the environmental variables needed to remotely access ROS on the Jackal and it starts RVIZ with a configuration file.
